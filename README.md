# **Project Name**  
_Finding ground-state solutions to Ising models using Quantum and Hybrid algorithims._


## **Features**  
- solve_ising_exact - provides an ecact solution for small lattices.
- solve_ising_annealing_dwave - provides a solution using DWave Quantum Annealer.
- solve_ising_qaoa = provides a solution using QAOA with Qiskit  

## **Key sources for Code**  
- solve_ising_qaoa - based off of IBM tutorial found [here](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm)
