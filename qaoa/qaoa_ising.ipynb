    "Suppose we have a function $C(z)$ which we want to minimize. Here, $z$ denotes a collection of variables $z = z_1,z_2,\\ldots, z_n$, where each $z_j$ can be either $+1$ or $-1$. (The important thing here is that each $z_j$ has *two possible values*. By convention, we choose those values to be $\\pm 1$). The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm whose goal is to produce an assignment of the $z_j$ that gives a relatively low value of $C(z)$. It's not guaranteed to give the lowest possible value of $C(z)$ (hence \"approximate\" in the name) except in a particular limit which we will discuss.\n",
    "\n",

To be more specific, let's agree that the value of $z_j$ corresponds to the measurement outcome of the Pauli-$Z$ operator on the $j$th qubit. (There is a potential confusion here because the state $| 0 \\rangle$ corresponds to $z = +1$, while the state $| 1\\rangle$ corresponds to $z=-1$. This is unfortunate, but is something that we'll just have to deal with.)"

In this way, when we measure the qubits we'll be more likely to find a bitstring with a small value of $C(z)$."
